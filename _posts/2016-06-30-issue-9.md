### 1. New Router now in main repository

In order to get the rewrite of the new router done quickly, the Angular team went kind of in stealth-mode and developed it in [angular/vladivostok](https://github.com/angular/vladivostok). With the release of RC3, the router has now been moved to the main repository, which means development will be continued there. You can find the source [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/modules/%40angular/router).

### 2. Data and Resolve landing in new Router

Something we've been waiting for! The router has its `resolve` and `data` functionality back!Here's what it looks like:

{% highlight js %}
export const MyRoutes = [
  { 
    path: '',
    component: NeedsResolveCmp,
    resolve: {
      thing: 'some-token'
    },
    data: {
      foo: 'bar'
    }
  }
];

// in our provider config

bootstrap(MyApp, [
  provideRouter(MyRoutes),
  { provide: 'some-token', useValue: 'thing' }
])

// in the loaded component
@Component()
class NeedsResolveCmp {

  constructor(route: ActivatedRoute) {
    route.snapshot.data.thing // 'thing'
    route.snapshot.data.foo // 'bar'
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### 3. PLATFORM_PIPES and PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES tokens are gone soon

Angular uses two tokens, `PLATFORM_PIPES` and `PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES`, to register [multi providers](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular2/2015/11/23/multi-providers-in-angular-2.html) for core pipes and directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor*`. These tokens will be gone soon as discussed [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9320), so if you happen to use them for your own pipes and directives, you might want to change your code now.

### 5. Devguide has been updated with new Form APIs

There has been many many improvements in the Forms APIs in the RC3 release and the official docs now reflect those changes. You can read them right [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html).

thoughtram also has two articles on [template-driven forms](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/03/21/template-driven-forms-in-angular-2.html) and [model-driven forms](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/06/22/model-driven-forms-in-angular-2.html) with practical examples.
