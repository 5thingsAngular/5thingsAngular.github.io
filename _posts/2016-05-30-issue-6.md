### 1. Http features

In order to implement authorization mechanisms in Angular 2, `@angular/http` finally implements `withCredentials`, so credential cookies can be sent to the server. This landed in master and is prolly gonna be part of RC2.

In addition, `Http` now sets the request Content-type header automatically based on the body type.

Thanks to [@templth](http://github.com/templth) for implementing both features!

### 2. Custom Interpolation Syntax

Another big feature that has been implemented recently is the ability to change the interpolation syntax used in Angular 2 components. So instead of using `{{ }}`, we can easily change those to `<< >>` using this simple provider configuration:


{% highlight js %}
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CompilerConfig } from '@angular/compiler';

@Component({
  template: 'Hello &lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;'
  providers: [
    { 
      provide: CompilerConfig,
      useFactory: () => {
        return new CompilerConfig(false, false, true, /<<([\s\S]*?)>>/g);
      },
      deps: []
    }
  ]
})
{% endhighlight %}

There are discussions on taking it even further so it work with [i18n too](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8865). Thanks to (@laco0416)[http://github.com/laco0416] for making this a thing!

### 3. New documentation on animations

The one and only [@teropa](http://twitter.com/teropa) spent some time with the animation APIs in Angular 2 (which recently landed) to write some top-noth documentation on it. You can check them out right [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1491);

###  4. Automatic XSRF handling

[Martin Probst](http://github.com/mprobst) is working on bringing security features to Angular 2. One of the latest implementations is automatic XRSF handling, which is a security feature know and love in Angular 1.

By default, Angular will look for a cookie called `'XSRF-TOKEN'` and set an HTTP request header called `'X-XSRF-TOKEN'` with the value of the cookie on each request.

We can easily override that cookie name tho, if we want:


{% highlight js %}
import { bootstrap } from '@angular/platform-browser/browser';
import { HTTP_PROVIDERS, XSRFHandler, CookieXSRFHandler } from '@angular/http';

bootstrap(App, 
  HTTP_PROVIDERS,
  { 
    provide: XSRFHandler,
    useValue: new CookieXSRFHandler('MY-XSRF-COOKIE-NAME', 'MY-XSRF-HEADER-NAME')
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}

### 5. i18n - Support implicit tags/attributes

There's been a lot of work going on lately in the i18n world. [Victor Berchet](http://github.com/vicb) added support for implicit i18n tags and attributes. If you want to learn more about the i18n plans in Angular 2, you might want to read [this article](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/03/21/angular-and-i18n-the-new-world.html).
