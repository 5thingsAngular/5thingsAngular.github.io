### 1. Alternative Router implementation

[Victor Savkin](http://twitter.com/victorsavkin) works on an alternative router implementation to try out different, easier APIs . This should also simplify the routing module.

### 2. Location service has been moved into platform/browser

`Location` provides APIs to access information about the current browser location. So far, this service was part of the router module. However, since there are cases where we need access to this information, even though there's no router in that application, this service has been moved to `platform/browser`. Thank you [Nathan Walker](http://twitter.com/wwwalterrun) for making this a thing!

### 3. Angular Material 2 Alpha 3 has been released!

The Angular Material 2 team released a new alpha version with fixes on input controls, buttons, sidenav and more! In addition, some new features landed like, a new progress bar, gestures and a11y features.

The full changelog can be read [here](https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-alpha3-cotton-candelabrum-2016-04-21).

Congrats, team!

### 4. Angular CLI now supports inlined templates and styles

When creating components using Angular CLI, it automatically creates a component file, a spec file as well as a template file and a CSS file for styles. Thanks to [Mike Brocchi](http://twitter.com/brocco) we now have an option to tell Angular CLI to make these things inline on creation like this:

{% highlight sh %}
$ ng create my-component --inline-style --inline-template
{% endhighlight %}

Or, if you prefer the shorthand version:

{% highlight sh %}
$ ng c my-component -is -it
{% endhighlight %}
