### 1. Angular 2 release candidate

Right on time for ngconf, Angular is now out of beta and the first release candidate has been published. This version includes a couple of breaking changes in terms of packaging. There's another release candidate that fixes a couple of bugs in the first release candidate. Check out the full changelog [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-rc1-2016-05-03).

### 2. Map literals as providers

If you've read our article about [DI in Angular 2](), you know that we can configure injectors using providers like this:

{% highlight js %}
@Component({
  ...
  providers: [
    provide(MyService, {useClass: OtherService})
  ]
})
class MyCmp {}
{% endhighlight %}

We can now use map literals to create providers which saves us a couple of keystrokes:

{% highlight js %}
@Component({
  ...
  providers: [
    { provide: MyService, useClass: MyService }
  ]
})
class MyCmp {}
{% endhighlight %}

### 3. Testing support for routing

Angular 2 now comes with a boundle that introduces `ROUTER_FAKE_PROVIDERS` to fake routing in tests. These providers can be applied using `beforeEachProviders()` like any other provider.

{% highlight js %}
describe('apps with router components', () => {
  beforeEachProviders(() => [ROUTER_FAKE_PROVIDERS]);

  it('should test something',
     async(inject([TestComponentBuilder], (tcb: TestComponentBuilder) => {
       tcb.createAsync(TestRouterComponent)
           .then((fixture) => { expect(fixture.nativeElement).toHaveText('one two'); });
     })));
});
{% endhighlight %}

### 4. HTML Sanitizer

Similar to Angular 1, there's now a HTML sanitizer which takes care of parsing the HTML document and serializes only specifically whitelisted elements.

### 5. Documentation updated to RC changes

Pretty much all of the official docs are now updated to match the latest changes introduced in the release candidate. Great work, docs team!
