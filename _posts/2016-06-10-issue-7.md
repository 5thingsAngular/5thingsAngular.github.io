### 1. ngUpgrade supports functions for template(Url)

`ngUpgrade` now supports upgrading directives where `template` or `templateUrl` is defined as a function, thanks to [@robwormald](http://github.com/robwormald).

### 2. `DatePipe` gets numeric string support

Angular 2's `DatePipe` gets support for numeric strings. `DatePipe` could not parse string values that represent actual numbers. This gets finally fixed once [this PR](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/9124) gets merged.

### 3. `ngSwitchWhen` is now `ngSwitchCase`

In a [previous issue](http://5thingsangular.github.io/2016/04/18/issue-2.html) we featured a refactor proposal that `ngSwitchWhen` is going to be renamed to `ngSwitchCase` to align with the EcmaScript standard. This is now merged and probably going to be released with RC 2.

### 4. `QueryList` becomes a `ReplaySubject`

This is a nice change which will cause `@ViewChildren`/`@ViewChild` and `@ContentChildren`/`@ContentChild` to emit their values immediately.

### 5. Tons of new docs in the making

As always, the documentation authoring team is working very hard on creating new content. Here's a list of what's in the making:

- [Validation cookbook](https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1627)
- [Security Developer Guide](https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1640)
- [Accessibility cookbook](https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1625)
- [Router Developer Guide](https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1636)

In addition, there's an effort to make *all* running example on angular.io accessible. You can view the progress [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1613).
