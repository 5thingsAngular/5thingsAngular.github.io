### 1. New NgTemplateOutlet directive

A new directive `NgTemplateOutlet` is currently in the making to enable creating embedded views from a template. Here's the idea:

{% highlight js %}
@Directive({
  selector: [myDir],
  template: '<template [ngTemplateOutlet]="currentTplRef"></template>',
  directives: [NgTemplateOutlet]
})
class MyDir {

  currentTplRef: TemplateRef;

  constructor(private currentTplRef: TemplateRef) {}
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<div *myDir>
  This is going to be inserted into myDir.
</div>

<!-- or alternatively -->

<template myDir>
  <div>This is going to be inserted into myDir.</div>
</template>
{% endhighlight %}

### 2. NgSwitchWhen will be renamed to NgSwitchCase

To stay consistent with JavaScript, `ngSwitchWhen` will be renamed to `ngSwitchCase`. This aligns more with JavaScript's `switch` statement.

The following code:

{% highlight html %}
<X [ngSwitch]="...">
  <Y *ngSwitchWhen="..."></Y>
  <Y *ngSwitchWhen="..."></Y>
  <Y *ngSwitchWhen="..."></Y>
  <Z *ngSwitchDefault></Z>
</X>
{% endhighlight %}

Will become:

{% highlight html %}
<X [ngSwitch]="...">
  <Y *ngSwitchCase="..."></Y>
  <Y *ngSwitchCase="..."></Y>
  <Y *ngSwitchCase="..."></Y>
  <Z *ngSwitchDefault></Z>
</X>
{% endhighlight %}

### 3. Support for custom i18n placeholders

At thoughtram we've [written](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/03/21/angular-and-i18n-the-new-world.html) about the new i18n support that'll land in Angular a long while ago. There's a lot of stuff happening the last couple of weeks and the newest addition is support for custom i18n placeholders in Angular templates.
