### 1. Static & dynamic browser platforms have been merged

With the release candidate, Angular's modules have been restructured to enable reusability on many different levels. Depending on where we want to bootstrap an app, we need to get hold of `bootstrap()` from different namespaces. Two of them were `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic` and `@angular/platform-browser` for online and offline compilation respectively.

These two namespaces have been merged.

### 2. App shell is now integrated in Angular-CLI

Progressive Web Apps seem to be the theme of 2016. Angular-CLI team works hard on making creating PWA with the CLI a breeze. Part of a PWA is a so called "app shell", which is basically the minimum HTML we want to load before our application starts fetching things asynchronously at runtime.

Using the `--mobile` flag when creating a new app, an app shell is now automatically generated and added to the scaffolded structure.

```
$ ng new --mobile my-project
```

### 3. Angular-CLI interface blueprint

Angular-CLI got even better as new blueprints are being added to the tool. One of the latest additions is a blueprint for creating interfaces. In other words, if you want to create a new interface, all you have to do is to run:

```
ng generate interface test-interface model
```

Which will essentially generate a file `test-interface.model.ts` with the dedicated interface definition in it.
